# Repository for Bachelor's Thesis â€“ *Homogenization in Rock Mechanics*

This repository supports the bachelor's thesis titled **"Homogenization in Rock Mechanics"**.  
It serves to manage versioning, store essential computations, and preserve all relevant data and source code developed and used throughout the research.  
The repository acts as an archive of results, simulations, and implementation details, useful for future reference or further development.

A detailed description of the methodology, results, and conclusions can be found in the thesis document available here:  
**`bachelor_thesis_siddall_czech.pdf`**
